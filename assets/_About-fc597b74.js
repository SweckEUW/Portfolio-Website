        my name is Simon Weck and I'm a Computer Graphics enthusiast. One of the things that excites me most about computer graphics is the ability to create compelling and immersive experiences that can transport audiences to new worlds 🪐. I am constantly seeking out new creative challenges, and I enjoy working on projects that allow me to push the boundaries of what is possible.
        
        I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and have gained experience in various software applications, such as Autodesk Maya, Adobe Photoshop, and After Effects. In addition, I am proficient in programming languages such as C#, JavaScript, and Python, and have experience with game engines such as Unity. I also have experience as a Web Developer, where I focused on developing 3D applications for the web.
